# Mask Detection using Machine Learning 

This repository is associated with [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/bCFtoUm5uH4).

In [this](https://youtu.be/bCFtoUm5uH4) video we made an app that detects if people are wearing surgical masks or not. 
We ueed [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) with the [mobilenet model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet) and [knn classifier](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/knn-classifier) to classify the images.

## Install and use the application

In order to install and use the application you just have to clone the repository and open the `index.html` file.
